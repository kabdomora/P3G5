  ## Project Description
  * This application is built using React, GraphQL (Node.js Express.js server), MongoDB
  
  * As a user...
      I want to be able to browse a gallery of currently housed pets
      ... so i can select a pet to view details

      I want to be able to click on a pet's profile
      ... so i can read its summary and potentially donate toward their needs

      I want to have a donate now button that takes me to a donation form-page
      ... so i can either:
      ...... select a specific pet to donate toward, or
      ...... donate toward the organization, generally

      I want to have a personal profile that contains my information and site history
      ... so i can keep track of the pets i've donated toward, and total donations to-date
